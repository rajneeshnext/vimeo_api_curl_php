# Integrating your website with Vimeo API to upload & manage videos

# Code will perform the following tasks

- Load the Vimeo iFrame form through API
- Upload Video through form and add jQuery listener to show upload progress in frontend
- (Vimeo creates a blank Vimeo video to start with)
- Check the Status of the uploaded video 
- Delete the video if it's not available in 30min, to keep the account clean.
