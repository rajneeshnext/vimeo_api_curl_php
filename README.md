# Integrating your website with Vimeo API to upload & manage videos

# Code will perform the following tasks

- Load the Vimeo iFrame form through API, and Vimeo creates a blank Vimeo video to start with.
- Check the Status of the uploaded video
- Delete the video if it's not available in 30min, to keep the account clean.
